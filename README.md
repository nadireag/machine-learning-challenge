## Machine-Learning - Exoplanet Exploration

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

Use Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn to create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about the findings and any assumptions that can be made based on the model.
* Is the model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not?
* What would make the model be better at predicting new exoplanets?
